# Gedankenspeicher

The project called Gedankenspeicher is a collection of scripts for using an annotation system with **txt** files. It builds upon the desktop wiki [zim-wiki]([GitHub - zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki: Main repository of the zim desktop wiki project](https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki)). The **txt** files are describing every given file on your filesystem. The created txt file is showing up in zim. So you can seach and annotate a file in zim wiki. Some scripts connect zim with the file manager perhaps [dolphin]([Dolphin - KDE Applications](https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/)) and the web browser [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). The scripts are working on linux machines like ubuntu, archlinux, fedora, suse. The Gedankenspeicher uses the following tools:

- wget

- xidel

- scrot

- sed

- zenity

- firefox addon application

- firefox addon zim clip

- noweb
